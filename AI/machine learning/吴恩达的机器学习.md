## 1.1 definition

>Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. – Arthur Samuel (1959)

>translate: 使计算机能够在没有被明确编程的情况下学习的研究领域

机器学习算法分类：

- supervised learning 
- unsupervised learning

## 1.2 supervised learning 

 Supervised learning: $x \rightarrow y$ or $input \rightarrow output\ label$, i.e, learning from being given "right answers"

**Application Examples**

| Input(X)         | Output(Y)              | <b style='color: orange'>Application</b> |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| email            | spam?(0/1)             | spam filtering                           |
| audio            | text transcripts       | speech recognition                       |
| English          | Spanish                | machine translation                      |
| ad,user info     | click?(0/1)            | online advertising                       |
| image,radar info | position of other cars | self-driving car                         |
| image of phone   | defect?(0/1)           | visual inspection                        |



**Two problem**

- regression: predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs(e.g., Housing price prediction)

- classification: predict categories, all of a small set of possible outputs(e.g., breast cancer detection)

## 1.3 unsupervised learning

In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning finds something interesting in <b style='color: green'>unlabeled data</b>.

The main types of unsupervised learning:
